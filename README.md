Getting started with GitHub

Hullo Everybody,

I'm learning Python and will be using GitHub to track changes and document the process. This is my first foray into coding. I love computers and have used them for a long time, but I have never learned coding. I hve decided to switch career paths and want to enter BI, so I am imporving my Excel skills, learning Python (as mentioned), and will be learnig Tableau and 'R'.

So let's go!

As ever,
